    <p>Hello! My name is Prudhvi Vejendla and a computer Science Student. I am currently pursuing my masters at Scared heart  University . I have a strong interest in software development and data analysis.I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Institute of Aeronotical Engineering. I have taken courses in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Systems, which have helped me build a strong foundation in coding.
	   I have worked on several projects during my time at university. One of my notable projects is a Weather Forecasting Application that I developed using Python and Machine Learning algorithms.I am proficient in Python, Java, and have experience with SQL. I also have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
